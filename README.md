# Basic HTML Site

A minimal static website built using **pure HTML** to demonstrate semantic structure and basic page layout.  
No CSS, no JavaScript, no frameworks — just clean, standards-compliant HTML.

## Repository

- **Repository Name:** basic-html-site
- **GitHub Link:** https://github.com/sharabshrestha99/basic-html-site

## Overview

This project showcases a simple website structure using modern semantic HTML elements such as:

- `<header>`
- `<nav>`
- `<main>`
- `<section>`
- `<footer>`

It is intended as a foundational example for beginners or as a baseline template for expanding into styled or interactive websites later.

## Features

- Fully static HTML
- Semantic and accessible structure
- Internal navigation using anchor links
- Clear content sections:
  - About

## Intended Use

- Learning basic HTML structure

## Limitations (By Design)

- No styling (CSS)
- No interactivity (JavaScript)

These omissions are intentional to keep the focus strictly on HTML structure.
